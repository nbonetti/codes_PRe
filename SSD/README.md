In this folder, you will find the different models used for SSD and RA. By modifying certain parameters, such as adding epsilon or k_ra as indicated in the report, you can obtain the correct matrices and reaction rates.

- **RA**  
  Simple model with replicative advantage for mutants.

- **2 units**  
  Extension of the SSD model with 2 units.

- **higher death rate**  
  Models exploring a higher mortality rate to observe "stochastic reversal selection."

- **birth-death process**  
  Ultra-simple model with a single species to understand the dynamics and differences between deterministic and stochastic resolutions.
