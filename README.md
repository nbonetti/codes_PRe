# Set of Codes Used

## Folder Structure

- **SSD and RA**: This folder contains the codes used for simulations related to SSD and RA analyses.
- **SSS**: This folder groups the codes necessary for SSS simulations.
- **SFS**: This folder contains the codes and simulations for the SFS part.

## Simulation Details

### SSD and SSS
The simulations for SSD and SSS were developed in Python and are executable via Jupyter Notebook. Although some simulations may take some time to run, they can be executed smoothly on a local machine.

### SFS
The simulations for SFS require extensive computational power, which necessitated the use of remote computing resources at Imperial College. In this folder, you will find:
- C and Python scripts used for the simulations.
- PBS scripts needed to submit jobs to the Imperial College HPC server.
