In this folder, you will find the codes useful for the simulations of the SSS model.

- **mutants only slowest 1 unit**  
  Simulation where `delta = 1` with 1 unit.

- **mutants only slowest 2 units**  
  Same simulation as above, but with 2 units.

- **2 species + mutants densest and slowest**  
  Here, mutants are characterized by a `delta > 0` and `delta < 1`, and are slow. This simulation is performed with 1 unit.

- **2 units mutants slowest + densest**  
  Same model as the previous one, but with 2 units.

- **2 units wildtypes slowest**  
  Model where the wildtypes are the ones that are slowed down.

- **2 species + M densest + W slowest**  
  Model where the wildtypes are slow with only 1 unit.
